## Notes on Remaining Warnings

### Apple Mobile Web App Meta Tag
The deprecation warning in the error log:
```
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"> is deprecated
```

This is automatically generated by Next.js from the `appleWebApp` metadata in `app/layout.tsx`. The current configuration is correct for Next.js 14 - the warning comes from Apple's deprecation of their own meta tag in favor of the standard `mobile-web-app-capable`.

**Action:** No change needed. Next.js handles this correctly, and the warning is harmless.
